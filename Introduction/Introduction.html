  In this study, human behavior is investigated in a <b>foraging game</b>. You will play a foraging game in a <b>galaxy</b> with <b>infinite planets</b>.
  </p>
  <p style="background-color:black; color: white;">
  
  The study consists of an <b>instruction page</b>, 
  a <b>foraging game</b> and a <b>questionnaire</b>. This experiment is going to take about <b>15-20 minutes</b>. 
  Your full <b>attention</b> is needed for this period. Therefore, we would like to ask you 
  to remove any distractions (e.g. phones) before starting to play the game.

    At the end of the game you can fill in your email address if you'd like to participate in the lottery to win a prize. 
    Out of the 5 best players, 1 will be randomly picked and paid according to their total score. This means that if the total score is for example 10000, the winner will receive 10 euros.
    The winner will be informed by email.

  purposes. Therefore, we would like to point out that your identity will remain completely <b>anonymous</b> and any information
  provided will remain completely <b>confidential</b>. The outcomes of this study may be used only for scientific purposes and will not be shared with any third parties.
