<p style="background-color:black; color: white;">
  In this study, we want to investigate human behavior in a <b>foraging game</b>. In this game you will have to collect 
  <b>ressources</b> in a <b>galaxy</b> with <b>infinite planets</b>.
  </p>
  <p style="background-color:black; color: white;">
  
  The study consists of an <b>instruction page</b>, <b>comprehension questions</b> to make sure the task is well understood, 
  a <b>foraging game</b> and a <b>questionnaire</b>. This experiment is going to take about <b>15-20 minutes</b>. 
  The game will be fast paced. Your full <b>attention</b> is needed for this period. Therefore, we would like to ask you 
  to remove any distractions (e.g. phones) before starting to play the game. 
  </p>

  purposes. Therefore, we would like to point out that your identity will remain completely <b>anonymous</b> and any information
