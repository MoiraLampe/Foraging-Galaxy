<h1 style="color: wheat;">Instructions</h1>

<p style="background-color:black; color: white;"> Imagine that you are on a <b>spaceship</b> in a <b>galaxy</b> with infinite <b>planets</b>. 
You left <b>planet Earth</b> because its resources have been fully depleted. You are one of the lucky ones who made it to one of the <b>spaceships</b>. 
Your survival now depends on finding a resourceful planet in order for you and your people to start a new life there. This is a foraging game and it is is about testing which
decisions you would make in such an environment. You will navigate through space, discover different planets, evaluate their value and decide whether you want to stay or move. 
The goal is to forage planets, which in turn will give you resource points and ultimately find a planet can provide you with the needed resources to survive and that you want to conquer. 

</p>


<h3 style="color: wheat;">Decisions</h3>
<p style="background-color:black; color: white;">

In the beginning of the game, you do not know anything about the galaxy. 
You also have little information about the planets. The only thing you know is that planets’ resources will be shown in terms of a payoff that can vary between [0, 100]. 

  </p>

  

  <p style="background-color:black; color: white;">
  
  You have 5 levels to complete. In every level you have a total of 100 decision rounds at hand. The 3 decisions you can make are either:

  <ol type="1">
    <li style="color: white;" >Exploiting the planet</li>
    <li style="color: white;">Keep exploring to find another planet</li>
    <li style="color: white;">Settle down on this planet</li>
  </ol> 

  </p>
  <p style="background-color:black; color: white;">
  
    If you decide to exploit a given planet, you will get to know how rich this planet is in terms of resources and how well you get to expand on this planet. 
    As mentioned above, this will be shown in terms of a payoff that can vary between [0, 100]. 
    Every planet in the galaxy has a randomly specified value that can vary randomly every round in an interval of [-10, 10]. 
  
  </p>
  <p style="background-color:black; color: white;">
  
    <b>Example</b>: Let’s say that planet 1 has a randomly specified value of 50. 
    Every round that you decide to exploit this planet’s resources, you will be given a random value that ranges between 40 and 60 [40, 60]. 
  </p>
  
  <p style="background-color:black; color: white;">
  
  By exploiting a planet, you learn more and more about its value, which will give you a better idea of whether this planet will be feasible for you and your people. 
  If you decide to exploit resources on a planet, you gather resources in the form of a payoff and you lose 1 decision round. 
    
  
  
  
  </p>
  <p style="background-color:black; color: white;">
  
    If you do not wish to stay on the current planet, because you do not like the payoff of the planet or because you believe that there might be a better planet in the orbit, 
    you can decide to keep exploring and thereby going to the next planet. 
    Travelling from one planet to the next one also comes with a cost. This is the exploration cost, that you will learn about before every level starts.

<h3 style="color: wheat;">Goal</h3>

      <p style="background-color:black; color: white;">
  
        Your goal is to maximize your payoffs in each level. At the end of each level, you will be given some feedback.
